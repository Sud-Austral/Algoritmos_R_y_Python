## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
ageandheight <- read_excel("R0_problema002.xlsx") #Upload the data
lmHeight = lm(Y~X, data = ageandheight) #Create the linear regression
summary(lmHeight)



```




```{r}

income.graph<-ggplot(ageandheight, aes(x=X, y=Y))+
                     geom_point()
income.graph


income.graph <- income.graph + geom_smooth(method="lm", col="black")

income.graph
```
